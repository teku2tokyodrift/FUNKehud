A HUD for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo.
